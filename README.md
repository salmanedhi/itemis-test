# ITEMIS Test Project
## Introduction

In this project we have created sales tax application which applies sales tax to a receipt of items and outputs the updated receipt containing the amount of the items along with the sales tax amount and total amount. 

I have created a project structure considering a real-world software which is why some packages are empty. Some more packages can be added based on the requirement of the project eg. model/dao, security, utils etc etc.
